# Studying Project: Docker Website
#### I've been studying Docker and Kubernetes for a while, and then I thought I could start a new project to practice some concepts and here it is.

## By now, this project has:

- A Dockerfile;
- A Docker-Compose that creates 3 containers with volume and its network;
- A Kubernetes Deploy with 2 pods, liveness and readiness probe and hpa;
- A Kubernetes Load Balancer service (for cloud hosting);
- A Kubernetes NodePort (for local hosting);
- A Kubernetes HPA file;
- A Kubernetes ConfigMap for environment variables;
- A Node.js (Express) server;
- Some static HTML files;
- CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT and DELETE);
- A cloud based database (MongoDB Atlas);

## What is missing (to be implemented soon):

- The logical part of "commands", "concepts" and "others";

## How to use:

- Set the .env file according to the .env.example;
- Open your terminal and type the command below:

```
docker-compose up
```
- Access it using the localhost IP address/your particular IP address.

## Considerations:

- I'm implementing things according to my free time;
- Feel free to reach me for some tips and improvements;
- This is supposed to be a just-for-practice project, so it's really basic.
